# Integration catalogue

The catalogue preserves all upstream dashboards and adds the infrastructure, operations and AI systems relevant to COStech. Priorities express delivery order, not product exclusion.

## Upstream baseline (preserve)

Portainer, Proxmox VE, TrueNAS Scale/Core, Unraid, Uptime Kuma, Dockhand, DockMon, Komodo, Beszel, Linux Update Dashboard, Crafty Controller, Pterodactyl, Calagopus, Gitea/Forgejo, Pangolin/Newt, Healthchecks, PatchMon, Wakapi, Pi-hole, AdGuard Home, UniFi, Technitium DNS, Maltrail, Nginx Proxy Manager/NPMplus, Plex, Jellystat, Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Prowlarr, qBittorrent, Jellyseerr, Bazarr, Gluetun and FlareSolverr.

Exporters are normally consumed through Prometheus rather than implemented as separate mobile dashboards. Microsoft and other broad OAuth APIs should normally be brokered through the optional gateway.

## Provider delivery rules

Every provider defines auth type, TLS support, capabilities, normalized resource/event mappings, pagination/rate limits, read/write scopes, minimum tested versions, error/redaction behavior and fixtures. Read-only delivery precedes actions. Remote shell and arbitrary script execution are out of scope until the action policy and audit pipeline exist.
